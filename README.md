**Financial Data Analysis and AI Chatbot Project**

**Overview**

This project was completed as part of a job simulation through Boston Consulting Group (BCG). The project focused on extracting, analyzing, and utilizing financial data from large companies to enhance an AI chatbot's capabilities.

**Project Components**

1. 10-K Financial Data Extraction
Objective: Extract financial data from the 10-K filings of three large companies.
Process: Retrieved key financial metrics, including total revenue, net income, total assets, and total liabilities.
Organized and stored the extracted data in an Excel file for further analysis.

3. Data Analysis in Jupyter Notebook
   
Objective: Perform basic data analysis using Python in a Jupyter notebook.

Process: Conducted exploratory data analysis (EDA) to understand the financial health of the companies.
Calculated year-over-year (YoY) changes and other key financial metrics.
Visualized the data using Python libraries like matplotlib and seaborn to identify trends and insights.

5. Feature Engineering
Objective: Enhance the dataset by creating new financial ratios and metrics.

Process: Developed custom financial ratios to provide deeper insights into the companiesâ€™ financial performance.
Engineered features such as profit margins, return on assets (ROA), and debt-to-equity ratios.

7. AI Chatbot Function Development
Objective: Assist in the development of a financial data AI chatbot by creating a function that answers predefined queries.

Process: Developed a function that allows the chatbot to answer specific financial questions based on company and year.
The function retrieves data related to total revenue, year-over-year income, and total assets.

Limitations: The function currently requires precise input formatting and only queries three specific financial metrics. Further development is required to broaden the chatbot's querying capabilities.

**Future Enhancements**

Expand Chatbot Capabilities: Enhance the AI chatbot to support a wider range of financial queries and improve user interaction by allowing more flexible input formats.

Advanced Data Analysis: Implement more complex data analysis techniques and machine learning models to provide predictive insights based on the financial data.

Integration with Live Data: Connect the chatbot to real-time financial data sources to provide up-to-date responses.

**Conclusion**

This project demonstrates the integration of financial data extraction, analysis, and AI to create a functional and insightful tool. The experience gained through this simulation provides a strong foundation for future work in financial data analysis and AI development.
